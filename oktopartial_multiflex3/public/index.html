        <p>Multiflex-3 is the third generation Multiflex template. Numerous improvements have been made since Multiflex-2: More modern appearance, more page layouts, new drop down menus with sticky hover zones, solid printer support, expanded browser support, fully scalable upwards and downwards when user resizes the default browser font size, and last but not least, a much better and easier code. But there is more than that. Check the navigation menu to discover all about the new Multiflex-3!</p>

        <h1>Release Notes</h1>
        <h2>Multiflex-3 / Update-7</h2>
        <h3>January 15, 2007</h3>
        <h6>Drop-down menu</h6>
        <p>Browser: Opera 9.10 / Description: In Opera 9.0.2 the drop-down meus behaved correctly, but in the latest version Opera 9.10, the drop-down main menu collapsed after hovering the main links. / Correction: In the CSS-class ".nav2 ul li a" the float statement was modified to "float:none !important /*Non-IE6*/; float:left /*IE-6*/;" in all "headerNN_setup.css" and "layoutNN_setup.css" files. The !important-float statement defines the behavior for Non-IE6 browsers including Opera, the other float-statement is for IE6.</p>
        <h6>Screenshots</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Description: Fresh screenshots have been made for Update-7.</p>
        <h2>Multiflex-3 / Update-6</h2>
        <h3>December 18, 2006</h3>
        <h6>Drop-down menu</h6>
        <p>Browser: IE6 / Description: When hovering the drop-down menu, the rounded-corners image from the sidebar or subcontent boxes are incorrectly placed above the drop-down menu. This bug was initiated by the changes made in Update-4 (see below) / Correction: In the CSS-class ".nav2 ul li" is modified by the parameters "z-index:auto !important /*Non-IE6*/; z-index:1000 /*IE6*/;" was added to all "headerNN_setup.css" and "layoutNN_setup.css". The !important statement is for Non-IE6 browsers, the other statement for IE6.</p>
        <h2>Multiflex-3 / Update-5</h2>
        <h3>December 17, 2006</h3>
        <h6>Breadcrumb section background</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Description: The replacement color (when image not found) for the background in the breadcrumbs section was set to its correct value. / Correction: For the CSS-class ".header-breadcrumbs" the replacement color-value for the parameter "background" was set to "rgb(255,255,255) in all "headerNN_setup.css" and "layoutNN_setup.css" files.</p>
        <h6>Centered images</h6>
        <p>Browser: Netscape / Description: Images positioned with "center" were displayed in left-justified position, but now correctly are displayed centered. / Correction: The CSS-class "img.center" was modified by including the parameter "display:block" and "width:auto" in all "layoutNN_text.css" files. As a result of this change, it is no longer necessary for the paragraph to be centered (&lt;p class="center"&gt;) when centering images. Paragraphs containing centered images are now simply coded as "&lt;p&gt;", without using any classes.</p>
        <h6>Footer height adjustment</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Description: The footer did not expand sufficiently in the vertical when browser font-sizes were increased. / Correction: For the CSS-class ".footer" the parameter "height" was removed, while top and bottom paddings were introduced in "padding", all in the "layoutNN_setup.css" files.</p>
        <h6>Sitemessage width and text</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Description: The site message in the middle header-has received an increased width. / Correction: For the CSS-class ".sitemessage" the parameter "width" was increased by 50px in all "headerNN_setup.css" and "layoutNN_setup.css" files.</p>
        <h6>Corrected top drop-down menu</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Description: Due to the changes in Update-4, an unwanted sideeffect appeared, namely that the sticky hover zones outside the drop-down submenu were missing on the right-hand side of the menu. The only way to resolve this issue was to remove the sticky hover zones altogether. / Correction: Reformulation and simplification of the CSS-classes belonging to ".nav2" in all "headerNN_setup.css" and "layoutNN_setup.css" files.</p>
        <h6>Javascript removed</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Description: In order for the navigation menu to remain flicker-free for IE browsers, a Javascript was used in the previous versions of Multiflex-3. However, since these hover zones have been removed (see topic above), this Javascript is no longer necessary. / Correction: Link to Javascript in the HTML header-section, the javascript directory "js", the javascript "ieflickerhack.js", and finally the background parameters for the sticky hovering background image in the CSS-class .nav2 were removed in all CSS and HTML files.</p>
        <h2>Multiflex-3 / Update-4</h2>
        <h3>December 11, 2006</h3>
        <h6>Drop-down menu critical bug solved</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Description: When hovering the drop-down submenu at very large font-sizes, i.e. when the menu is shown on two or more lines, the hovered submenu is now shown on top of other main menu items. Until now, the hovered submenu would erroneously appear below other menu main items, thus making it impossible to reach those submenu links. / Correction: Removed the "z-index:1000" parameter in the CSS-class ".nav2 ul li" in all "headerNN_setup.css" and "layoutNN_setup.css" files.</p>
        <h2>Multiflex-3 / Update-3</h2>
        <h3>December 4, 2006</h3>
        <h6>Browser compatibility increased</h6>
        <p>Browser: Konqueror, Netscape and Mozilla / Description: Drop-down menus now correctly open up vertically. / Correction: Added a width-specification for the CSS-class ".nav2 ul li:hover ul" in "headerNN_setup.css" and "layoutNN_setup.css".</p>
        <h6>IE flicker hack moved</h6>
        <p>Browser: IE / Description: Flicker bug hack now moved from CSS to Javascript, for compatibility with IE6 versions before SP1. / Correction: Delted "html{expression...}" from "headerNN_setup" and "layoutNN_setup", and placed the code in the Javascript file "ieflickerhack.js" in the directory "js". Advantage is, that the CSS-file now validates correctly.</p>
        <h6>Browser screenshots</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Modification: Individual image links removed, instead a general link to my homepage directory containing the screenshots of interest. Advantage is that screenshots can be added or deleted without breaking any links in the template.</p>
        <h6>Footer text</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Modification: Designer credits now reads "Design by", instead of before "Original Design by".</p>
        <h2>Multiflex-3 / Update-2</h2>
        <h3>November 29, 2006</h3>
        <h6>Printer layout and background color</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Description: When printing, a gap was created between the header-and the content section. Further, no background color was printed for the left navigation sidebar. / Correction: Removed erroneous vertical padding in CSS-class ".header-breadcrumbs in all CSS-files "layoutNN_setup.css". Further, included a printer CSS statement for the class ".main-navigation" in CSS-files "layoutNN_setup.css".</p>
        <h6>Template links</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Modification: All template links now point to my homepage, instead of to Open WebDesign. This change was done in "index.html".</p>
        <h2>Multiflex-3 / Update-1</h2>
        <h3>November 27, 2006</h3>
        <h6>Drop-down menu items</h6>
        <p>Browser: IE7 / Description: Misbehavior when hovering main link by showing multiple columns / Correction: Reformulated conditional "if" statements in "layoutNN.html", "headerNN.html" and "index.html".</p>
        <h6>Bottom header-background</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Description: Background gap between bottom header-and breadcrumbs when browser font-size reduced / Correction: Added background to the CSS-class ".bottom-header" in "layoutNN_setup.css".</p>
        <h6>Rounded corners line</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Description: When decreasing or increasing browser font size, a horizontal line appears above the rounded corners for subcontent boxes with boundary. Effect happens when font-size resizes, but page is not reloaded. / Solution: Simply reload the page, and the horizonal line disappears. This is a Safari bug which we have no control over.</p>
        <h6>Top search form</h6>
        <p>Browser: Konqueror 3.4 / Description: Field width available for search form widened, so that "Go" button appears to the right, and not below, the search area. / Modification: CSS-class ".header breadrumbs" changed in "headerNN_setup.css" and "layoutNN_setup.css".</p>
        <h6>Search form layout</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Description: Search forms now have their "Go" buttons below the search entry field (only exception is search form below the page header). Reason for this is that Design remains consistent when browser font-sizes are resized / Modification: CSS-class ".button" changed in "headerNN_setup.css" and "layoutNN.css".</p>
        <h6>Button styles</h6>
        <p>Browser: All / Description: Default buttons are styled very differently for different browsers. / Correction: To harmonize button appearance we have now styled the buttons explicitly. However, Camino and Safari overrule this style with Mac-specific buttons. / Modification: CSS-class ".button" changed in "headerNN_setup.css", "layoutNN_setup.css" and "layoutNN_text.css".</p>
        <h6>Credits for flags</h6>
        <p>Credits were included for the flags.</p>

        <p>In 2006 I decided to start my own website. When surfing around I didn't find the template I needed. So I began to develop my own, with trials, errors and many long nights. About half a dozen experiments and six months later, I feel that I am coming closer to the Design I need! But I will try to push it one step further, and make a liquid layout.</p>
        <p>I have profited much from others who have shared their CSS-knowledge on the internet. The best way to show my appreciation is by sharing my results with others. So if this template is what you were looking for, then feel free to use and enjoy it!</p>
        <p>If you want to get in touch with me, you can check my website or email me via <a href="http://www.free-css.com/">OSWD.org</a> contact form.</p>
